<h4><center>Unlucky Adventures</center></h4>
<p>Unlucky Adventures is a turn-based RPG where you are the hero of your story. Explore dungens, find loot, battle tough enemies, and level-up in your quest to become the ultimate adventurer!
</p>  
<ul>
<h4><center>Gameplay/Mechanics</center></h4>
<li>Player controlled team of min-1 max-3 vs ai controlled enemies min-1 max-4</li>
<li>Utilize an interactive based system to spice up combat and reward reaction, game knowledge, and skill but keep downside of misuse low</li>
<li>Utilize a battle mechanic (TENSION) that can be used by both player and enemies to turn fights and add a layer of strategy</li>
<li>Use a beginning class-based system that can flexibly become any other class based on where the player puts their experience into (stats) </li>
</ul>

<h4><center>Gameplay Interface</center></h4>

 This is an example of how the combat interface will look in the middle of combat. Both the health and the mana of the active player will be displayed at the top-left section of the screen along with the character portrait. The player will sequence a normal encounter by taping one of the actions provided, selecting a target for that action, then following a prompt that can involve interactions such: tapping the screen repeatedly for more hits, timing a single tap to time a precision-based attack, have a long press then release for channel-based attacks and more.
Tension used in battle allows for higher damage, the use of some special moves, and ultimate moves from both allies and enemies. This will be one of the most important things the player will have to strategically use as it can be also used against them. 
The turn order clock based on character speed. Portraits of both enemies and allies are shown on the timeline to clarify who’s turn will be next (left last/ right first). Turn order is dictated by the Speed of characters but can also be interacted by being able to interrupt channeling attacks to set the disrupted character back in the turn order.

 Unlucky Adventures will primarily be pixel art to capture the feel of old-school RPGs. It will also be given a cartoony and colorful feel with its variety of enemies, characters, and levels to give off a light-hearted aesthetic. As such, I believe that the PixelBox game engine would be great for the game, especially for the dungeon and Hub designs. PixelBox is a 2D game engine that combines an easy-to-use JavaScript API with a complete set of editing tools including a map editor, sprite tools, palette tools, sound FX and music tools. It is also very amateur friendly as it requires little coding experience and has plenty of tutorials available online. It is also free to download so Unlucky adventure could start its production as soon as possible.
	Another game engine that would be ideal for this game is Unity. With popular mobile games such as Angry Birds and Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft that use the engine, I can see Unlucky Adventure also using simple 2D animations becoming very smooth on the Unity engine. Unity uses the C# language to handle its code and logic which is one of the more beginner-friendly programming languages. Unity also has many important features, such as physics and collision detection, that are built-in to make development much easier. Unlucky Adventures’ combat sequences and animations could shine through the Unity engine adding a layer of flair to the game.
